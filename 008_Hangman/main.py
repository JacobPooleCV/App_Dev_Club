import hangman_words

#Step 1: Create a word list using the hangman_words.py print
# (hangman_words.word_list)


# Step 2: Get a random word from this list(try searching up how to use ransom.choice())

# Step 3: Print out the word for now. This will help with testing as you make the game. You can remove this later.


# Note 1: Using the stages and the clear() method in your final result are not necessary, but look nice.

# Note 2: This is a harder lab. It will likely take some time, but remember to break apart the problem as you work at it.
